        I am driven by a mission to help change the world around me for the better.
        My product management experience started in 2016 when I joined a tech consulting firm (Cotta & Cush) that builds products for businesses.
        I have built solutions for teams in a number of industries which includes: advertising, non-profit, insurance and edtech.
        Some of my responsibilities over the past 5 years include; conducting user and market research to understand needs and identify opportunities, contributing to product strategies and vision, crafting roadmaps, communicating to stakeholders in a language they understand, collaborating across different business functions, working with agile development teams to build products, identifying & measuring metrics and working to improve product performance. I am proficient with JIRA, MySQL, Tableau, Figma, Google Analytics  and making presentations to mention a few. I am familiar with Miro, Python and I am currently tinkering with HTML & CSS.
